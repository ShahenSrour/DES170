            You were amazing and explained everything in great detail even on the day when I had my senior design
            presentation you recorded the session for me.<br>your grading was fair and did not judge me as if I was a
            CAAD student (I think at least)<br>you are a little too sensitive/apologetic. like if I am talking back then
            I am asking for direct instructions on what I can improve, instead you would answer something along the
            lines of " I am sorry I didn't explain that well" and you would rephrase it<br>you explained it clearly
            trust me but I was probably thinking about the grade of 3/40 in one of my courses to the point where my
            brain stoppped working.<br><br>I really have nothing negative to say or I would've already told you</p>

        <p>
            thank you professor for an amazing semester and a fun course and lecture (I slept once or twice but come-on
            I can't control that)</p>
