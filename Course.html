        <h1>1st Project</h1>
        <p>
            I hate blue foam, but overall the project was okay. Yes, the orthographic drawing was a disaster (like
            almost everything there), but at least it's done now.
        </p>
        <h1>2nd Project</h1>
        <p>
            The second project involved a lot of work—from sketching (which I rarely do, since I usually visualize
            everything in my head) to modeling with clay, then scanning it, importing it into Rhino, and creating all
            the necessary drawings, like orthographic, exploded, and perspective views.
        </p>
        <p>
            It wasn’t as time-consuming as I initially expected, but the work required completing it in one sitting,
            which I found challenging.
        </p>
        <p>believe me when I say, I do not know how I got a worse great than the first project but it is what it is</p>
        <h1>3rd Project</h1>
        <p>I hate blue foam, but overall the project was ok<br>yes the orthographic drawing was a disaster (like almost
            everything there)<br> but it is done</p>
        <p>UPDATE: Grades are out and WOW!????</p>
        <h1>Booklet</h1>
        <p>I love the booklet part but I think I paniced a little. I sent everything to the printery at 2-5-2025 before
            even<br>recieving my 3D print because I thought the submission was that day</p>
        <p>UPDATE: 22/10 I really don't know what to say</p>
